# Hangman
[![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/badge/github/Soadaa56/hangman)](https://replit.com/new/github/Soadaa56/hangman)

This project is part of the The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

# Instructions

With Replit link go to the shell tab and type "ruby /lib/hangman.rb" (I need to learn how to use replit to make it easier for users to test application).

For this game a word will be chosen from a list of length 5-12 letters. The player will know the length of the random word and guess one letter each turn. The game will be over when the random word is fully spelled out, or if the player reaches a total of 7 incorrect guesses.
